# ✅ ENHANCED: Weak vs. Strong Examples + BCR Explainers

## What We Just Added

### 1. BCR Explainer (For Non-Experts)

**Every BCR question now includes:**

```
What is a BCR?
A Band Council Resolution is an official decision by Chief and Council 
that authorizes actions on behalf of the First Nation. For grants, it shows 
leadership approval and authorizes someone to submit/sign agreements.

Timeline: 2-4 weeks typically (depends on meeting schedule)
Required for: Nearly all First Nation grant applications

```

Users can click "Download BCR Template" and get a complete, customizable BCR!

### 2. Weak vs. Strong Examples (For Every Question!)

**Now each question shows side-by-side comparison:**

#### Example: Forest Classification Question

**❌ Weak Example:**
```
"Old growth and second growth forest with cedar and hemlock."
```

**✅ Strong Example:**
```
"Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic zone, primarily vh1 and vm1 
site series. Forest stands are predominantly 60-100 year old second growth 
western hemlock and Douglas-fir with scattered legacy western redcedar 
(150-300 years old). Site index ranges from SI 25-35."
```

**Why strong works:** Uses technical forestry terminology, provides specific data, shows professional knowledge

## Examples of Weak vs. Strong for Key Questions

### Q: Cultural Benefits

**❌ Weak:**
"Will help preserve our culture and create some jobs."

**✅ Strong:**
"• Enhanced access to traditional medicines at 8 sites
• 3 full-time positions (6 months each)  
• Protection of 15 culturally modified trees
• Elder-led sessions (6 planned) for knowledge transmission
• Restoration of traditional food species across 100+ hectares"

**Why strong:** Specific and quantified, multiple benefit types, shows planning depth

---

### Q: Climate Benefits

**❌ Weak:**
"Will reduce emissions and help forests adapt to climate change."

**✅ Strong:**
"Three mechanisms: (1) Emissions reduction - retention harvest avoids slash 
burning of 500 tonnes biomass (250 tonnes CO2e avoided vs. conventional), 
(2) Enhanced carbon storage - 15-20% retention maintains 1,200 tonnes CO2 in 
live trees over 50 years, (3) Climate adaptation - drought-tolerant cedar 
provenances from 200m lower elevation increase survival under +2°C scenarios."

**Why strong:** Three specific mechanisms, quantified where possible, shows technical understanding

---

### Q: BCR Status

**❌ Weak:**
"Will get one."

**✅ Strong:**
"BCR-2024-087 approved at Chief & Council meeting on November 30, 2024. 
Resolution authorizes Lands Manager Sarah Johnson to submit application 
and sign funding agreements subject to final C&C approval. Original BCR 
attached with application."

**Why strong:** Specific date, BCR number, named signatory, confirms document is ready
