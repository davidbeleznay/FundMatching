# Enhanced Grant Readiness - Now with 17 Questions!

## What Just Changed

**Expanded from 9 → 17 questions** to give users a much more accurate picture of true submission readiness.

## The Problem We Solved

**Before (9 questions):**
- User could score 80% by writing good content
- But maybe they don't have BCR yet... (can't actually submit!)
- Or no budget detail... (application would be weak!)
- Or permits not identified... (will get rejected!)

**After (17 questions):**
- User scores 45% because they haven't actually **prepared to submit**
- System identifies blockers: "Need BCR - 2-4 week wait"
- Shows honest readiness: content vs. actual ability to submit

**Test 1: "Not Actually Ready"**
- Answer content questions well
- But say: "BCR not yet", "Budget rough", "Permits unknown"
- Should score ~50% and show "Not Ready"

**Test 2: "Actually Ready"**  
- Answer content questions
- Say: "BCR approved", "Budget detailed", "Permits identified"
- Should score ~85% and show "Ready to Submit"
